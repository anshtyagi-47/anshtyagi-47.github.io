## Day 29 Highlights

Building on yesterday’s foundation, today I focused on **bringing the Products page to life** by adding actual product information and improving the UI for a more polished look.

### Focus of the Day — Content Integration & Visual Improvements

The main goal was to move from placeholder cards to meaningful, user-ready product displays.

Here’s what I accomplished:

- **Product Data Integration**  
  Replaced placeholder cards with real product names, images, and brief descriptions that align with AG Enterprises’ offerings.

- **Enhanced Product Cards**  
  Added hover effects, action buttons (e.g., “View Details”, “Inquiry”), and labels for featured items to make cards more interactive and visually appealing.

- **Responsive Layout Adjustments**  
  Used **media queries** to ensure the product grid adapts smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile screens.

- **Consistent Design Refinement**  
  Applied typography, color scheme, and spacing consistent with the homepage for a seamless browsing experience.

- **CTA Section Setup**  
  Drafted a bottom-page call-to-action encouraging users to reach out or explore more products.

### What’s Next?

- Finalize and optimize product images
- Add filtering and sorting functionality (JavaScript)
- Implement product detail pop-ups or dedicated pages
- Test layout on multiple devices for responsiveness

### Reflections

Seeing real products on the page transformed its look and feel—it finally resembles a functional catalog rather than a wireframe. Small UI enhancements like hover effects and buttons added depth without overcomplicating the design.

The next steps will push this page towards being **fully interactive and user-friendly**, setting the stage for smooth navigation and product discovery.
