# Day 3: Mastering Git Collaboration â€“ Remotes, Pull Requests & Conflict Resolution

Today was a deep dive into **collaborative Git workflows**, focused on mastering remotes, creating pull requests (PRs), handling merge conflicts, and understanding team-based Git operations. I went beyond local version control to understand **how teams manage and review code** effectively using Git and GitHub.

## Why Learn Git Collaboration?

While basic Git commands help manage individual work, **collaborative workflows** are essential in real-world development where:
- Multiple developers contribute to a shared codebase
- Changes are peer-reviewed before being accepted
- Merge conflicts and diverging codebases are common

Understanding how to collaborate efficiently with Git helps **maintain code quality, prevent bugs, and streamline team workflows**.

I started by linking my local repository to a remote GitHub repository. This forms the foundation of team collaboration.

### Commands Used

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:anshtyagi/myproject.git
git push -u origin main
