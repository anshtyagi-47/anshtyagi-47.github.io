## Day 21 Highlights

Today I officially started working on a **new web design challenge project** assigned by my mentor. This isn't just another exercise â€” it's a real design task meant to simulate client-based work. The project aims to test my ability to plan, structure, and design a user-friendly webpage from scratch, applying everything Iâ€™ve learned so far.

### Project Brief

The project brief was open-ended, giving me the flexibility to decide the layout, structure, and visual direction. This made it exciting but also challenging, since I had to think not just like a developer but like a designer too. My mentor emphasized a clean, modern, and responsive layout with attention to usability and visual hierarchy.

## Planning Phase

I started with brainstorming and concept mapping to figure out how to organize the sections of the webpage. I asked myself:

- Whatâ€™s the purpose of the page?
- Whoâ€™s the target audience?
- What should be the first thing a user notices?
- Whatâ€™s the best way to present the content in a structured flow?

After answering these, I moved on to layout sketching:

### Wireframe Concepts

- Sketched rough layouts on paper and digitally.
- Designed sections like:
  - Hero Section (with headline, CTA, background image)
  - Feature Highlights (3-4 cards)
  - About/Introduction Block
  - Testimonials or Social Proof
  - Footer with navigation + contact

I experimented with both single-column and grid-based approaches, using margin spacing and whitespace strategically.

## Development Kickoff

Once I was satisfied with the structure, I started coding:

- Built the base HTML structure using semantic elements (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
- Applied a responsive CSS reset and set up a root stylesheet with custom variables.
- Initialized layout using **Flexbox** for mobile-first responsiveness.
- Focused on clean class naming and reusability to avoid clutter.

## Key Learnings Today

- Planning and structure are **just as important** as writing code.
- Having a visual roadmap (like a wireframe) speeds up development and keeps it organized.
- This kind of open project helps build confidence and creative problem-solving skills.

## ðŸš€ Tomorrowâ€™s Goals

- Style the hero section and make it visually engaging.
- Finalize color scheme and fonts based on modern UI principles.
- Begin working on the features and about section layout.

This challenge is really stretching my abilities and giving me a deeper understanding of what it takes to bring a concept to life on the web. I'm excited to see where this project goes!
