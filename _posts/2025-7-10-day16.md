## Day 16 Highlights

Today I worked with motion and structure in CSS. I explored animations and transitions in depth, including how to define and control custom animations using `@keyframes` and transformation properties. Alongside, I also focused on writing CSS that is scalable and maintainable using best practices like BEM and OOP-style organization.

## What I learned

- How to define custom animations using `@keyframes` and percentage steps.
- Using `transform` functions like `translate`, `scale`, and `rotate` in animations.
- Creating smooth transitions with `transition-property`, `duration`, and `timing-function`.
- Understanding the difference between transitions and animations.
- Structuring CSS using OOP principles for better scalability.
- Naming conventions using BEM (Block Element Modifier) for clarity and modularity.

## Exercise Completed

- Built a custom animation that rotates and scales elements over time.
- Applied hover transitions to links and buttons for interactive feedback.
- Created multiple animation states using percentage steps in keyframes.
- Refactored existing CSS using BEM naming for better readability.
- Organized code into reusable and consistent blocks following OOP-like patterns.

## Concepts Practiced

- `@keyframes` syntax and animation flow control.
- `transform` and `transition` combinations for motion effects.
- BEM methodology for CSS class naming.
- CSS modularization for large-scale project readiness.
- Importance of consistency and separation of concerns in stylesheets.
- - Explore animation timing functions in more detail (`ease-in-out`, `cubic-bezier`).

## Reflection

Animations added visual life to the page, but controlling them precisely required attention to timing, easing, and transform combinations. Structuring CSS sustainably was another big lesson — I had to revisit fundamentals to understand how large projects are maintained. These practices will help me scale codebases efficiently in future work.

## Next Steps

- Start exploring SCSS to further modularize and organize styles.
