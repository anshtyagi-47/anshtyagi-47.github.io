## Day 17 Highlights

Today was a major step forward as I worked on building the Moshify website. What seemed like simple concepts when I first learned them became far more interesting and complex during implementation. I came to understand how crucial the basics are — and how different they feel when actually used to build a full interface.

## What I learned

- How to structure a full web page using HTML and CSS from scratch.
- Applied concepts of inputs and input groups in a structured form layout.
- Created visually appealing cards, pricing plans, and media objects.
- Understood how to use media queries for responsiveness, though struggled at times with layout shifts.
- Learned that websites often contain multiple grid structures on a single page, unlike my previous single-grid practice.
- Discovered Photoshop principles that help in identifying and recreating UI elements from a design.
- Corrected small but frequent typos that can break layout and learned to debug layout issues more efficiently.

## Exercise Completed

- Built the Moshify site layout as part of the training project.
- Styled cards, buttons, and input sections with form controls.
- Created pricing plan sections using flex and grid.
- Built reusable media object layouts for testimonial sections.
- Implemented custom styles and tried adding my personal touch to the project.
- Practiced organizing styles with BEM and utility classes.

## Concepts Practiced

- Input and input group styling for forms.
- Media objects layout using flexbox.
- Responsive grid structures with varying breakpoints.
- Practical use of CSS variables and consistent spacing.
- Implementing design based on visual reference using Photoshop rules.

## Reflection

Today showed me how different implementation feels compared to isolated learning. The small concepts — like grids, inputs, margins — become powerful tools when used together, but they also reveal where I need more confidence. Media queries and complex grid combinations were especially challenging but valuable. I learned how messy real-world layouts can be and how important patience, debugging, and careful structure are in building something functional and beautiful.

## Next Steps

- Refine grid usage and learn how to better manage nested and mixed grid structures.
- Explore more advanced responsive strategies using flex and grid together.
- Revisit media queries for better control of breakpoints and layout shifts.
- Continue building my custom version of Moshify to apply everything I'm learning.
