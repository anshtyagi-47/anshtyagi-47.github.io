## Day 14 Highlights

Today I focused on creating the foundational blocks of a modern landing page. I implemented the navigation bar, hero section with optimized imagery, and a features block. These sections brought together the layout and visual structure of the homepage, and helped me see how critical detail and consistency are when working across multiple components.

## What I learned

- Used flexbox to build a responsive navigation bar with aligned logo and links.
- Designed and implemented a hero section with heading, description, CTA, and image.
- Learned how to optimize hero images for faster load times and better resolution handling.
- Built a features block with multiple icon-text pairs to highlight product strengths.
- Understood how to control layout using spacing, padding, and flex directions.
- Found out how small details like margin and text alignment make a big difference in visual balance.

## Exercise Completed

- Created a responsive navigation bar using HTML and flexbox.
- Implemented a hero section with optimized image and styled text content.
- Designed and styled a features block using flex and grid for visual appeal.
- Applied image compression and explored formats like WebP for optimization.
- Worked on spacing consistency between different homepage sections.

## Concepts Practiced

- Flexbox alignment and space-between utilities for navigation.
- Image responsiveness and optimization techniques (e.g., using `srcset`, compression).
- Section padding and margin for consistent visual flow.
- Grid/flex hybrid layouts for multi-item sections like features.
- Clean and semantic HTML structure for better readability and accessibility.

## Reflection

Building these sections was a great exercise in real-world structure and layout flow. Even though I had learned flexbox and grid before, applying them in combination revealed new challenges. The hero image section taught me how much difference optimization can make to performance. I also realized the importance of revisiting basic layout techniques — every pixel of spacing can affect the overall look. Structuring and refining these blocks gave me a better sense of building modular, reusable components.

## Next Steps

- Add interactivity to navigation and buttons for enhanced UX.
- Refine spacing across sections to ensure visual balance.
- Study more image optimization tools and performance audits.
- Start working on the testimonials and footer blocks for full homepage structure.
