## Day 28 Highlights

With the homepage complete, today I officially began working on the **Products page** of my business website. This marks the start of the second major section of the site — and one that’s critical in showcasing offerings in a clean, user-friendly format.

### Focus of the Day — Laying the Foundation

I spent today structuring and planning the content layout for the Products page, while also beginning to build out the base UI.

Here’s what I accomplished:

- **Page Structure Setup**  
  Created a new HTML file and integrated it into the site’s navigation. I kept the layout consistent with the homepage — header and footer reused for uniformity.

- **Section Planning**  
  Outlined the main sections:

  - Product header/introduction
  - Product grid
  - Featured/highlighted items
  - CTA or inquiry section

- **Initial Layout Implementation**  
  Began working on the product grid using **Flexbox** for a responsive layout. Set up placeholder cards for each product with image slots, titles, and brief descriptions.

- **Styling Base Elements**  
  Added base styles for product cards, consistent spacing, and typography. Ensured the design system from the homepage carries over to maintain visual continuity.

### What’s Next?

- Add actual product data and imagery
- Refine the card design (hover effects, buttons, labels)
- Make the layout fully responsive
- Explore adding filters or categories (possibly with JavaScript)

### Reflections

Starting the Products page felt smooth, thanks to the foundational work done on the homepage. I’m starting to see how modular components and consistent design choices can make scaling a website easier.

This page will be a test of both **design sensibility** and **practical UX thinking** — how to present information clearly while keeping the layout visually engaging.
