# ðŸ“… 5/7/2025 - Day 12: Working with Web Images

## 1. Image Types

Learned the differences between raster (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP) and vector (SVG) image formats, and when to use each for the web.

## 2. Background Images

Practiced applying images as CSS backgrounds using `background-image`, with properties like `background-size`, `repeat`, and `position` for layout control.

## 3. Content Images

Explored how to embed meaningful images directly into HTML using the `<img>` tag, including setting `alt` attributes for accessibility and SEO.

## 4. Data URLs

Learned how to embed small images directly in HTML/CSS as base64 data URLs to reduce HTTP requests â€” useful for icons and small assets.

## 5. Image Slicing

Understood techniques like image sprites and slicing large images for UI components, to improve layout flexibility and performance.

## 6. CSS Filters

Explored applying visual effects using `filter` properties like `blur`, `grayscale`, `brightness`, and `contrast` directly in CSS.

## 7. Resolution Switching

Learned how to serve higher resolution images on retina screens using `srcset` and `sizes` with the `<img>` tag.

## 8. Art Direction

Used the `<picture>` element with multiple `<source>` tags to change images based on viewport size, for better control over layout and storytelling.

## 9. Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

Learned how SVGs work, how to embed them inline or by reference, and the advantages of SVGs for icons, illustrations, and crisp scalability.

## 10. Image Optimization

Explored image compression techniques, choosing appropriate formats, lazy loading, and tools like ImageOptim or Squoosh for reducing file size without quality loss.

## Summary

Today was focused on mastering **image handling and performance** for the web. I now have a solid understanding of both **technical tools** (like `srcset`, `picture`, SVGs, filters) and **best practices** (like when to use background vs content images, and how to optimize them).

This session also builds a strong foundation for responsive design and page performance going forward.
