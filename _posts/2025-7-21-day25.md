## Day 25 Highlights

Today marked the **first step into building my own business website**, a project I’ve been envisioning for a while. After wrapping up CSS and gaining confidence in responsive layouts, visual structure, and design principles, I felt ready to start something real and personal.

### Project Overview — My Business Website

The goal is to create a fully responsive, visually appealing, and functional website for a hypothetical or real business idea. It will showcase my ability to design with intent, code cleanly, and bring together all that I’ve learned so far — while also pushing into new territory with **JavaScript**.

Here’s what I set up today:

- **Project Planning & Structure**  
  I brainstormed the pages and structure the site will need: a homepage, about section, services, testimonials, and contact. I also sketched some wireframes and outlined a component-based structure.

- **Initial File Setup**  
  Created the folder structure for HTML, CSS, images, and scripts. I set up a base HTML template and linked my CSS and JavaScript files for scalability.

- **Homepage Skeleton**  
  I built the basic HTML structure of the homepage, using semantic tags and ensuring accessibility in mind from the start. It includes a hero section, navbar, and placeholder sections for the rest of the content.

- **Design System Initialization**  
  I defined a simple design system: font choices, color palette, spacing units, and reusable utility classes. This will help keep the design consistent as the site grows.

### Focus Areas for the Coming Days

- **Refining the layout using CSS Grid & Flexbox**
- **Adding interactivity with JavaScript (nav toggles, form handling, etc.)**
- **Optimizing for responsiveness and accessibility**
- **Polishing UI with transitions, hover states, and animations**

### Reflections

Starting a business website from scratch feels like a big leap — and it is. It’s exciting and a little overwhelming, but also incredibly rewarding to build something that feels _mine_. It’s not just about applying what I’ve learned — it’s about learning to think like a real developer: planning, iterating, and polishing with purpose.

One thing is clear: all the foundational work with HTML and CSS has paid off. I’m building with confidence, and I know exactly where I’m going — even if I’ll hit a few roadblocks along the way.
