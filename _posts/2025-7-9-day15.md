## Day 15 Highlights

Today was packed with practical interface work. I explored icon integration, created responsive menus, and built a sign-in form. Although the tasks looked simple on the surface, a lot of small things took time and effort to get right.

## What I learned

- How to use icon libraries like Font Awesome effectively.
- Designing a responsive navigation menu with hover effects.
- Adjusting layouts for different screen sizes: mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Building and styling a functional sign-in form.
- Understanding form input types, focus states, and validation basics.

## Exercise Completed

- Created a horizontal navigation menu with hover underline animation.
- Designed different menu layouts for mobile and tablet using media queries.
- Built a basic sign-in form using input, label, and button elements.
- Customized form styles with padding, borders, and transitions.

## Concepts Practiced

- Responsive design using @media queries.
- Hover effects and transitions in navigation.
- Flexbox and layout adjustments across screen sizes.
- Form styling and interactive input states.

## Reflection

Despite appearing straightforward, today's tasks involved many fine details. Small issues like spacing, alignment, and hover behavior consumed significant time. I learned the importance of breaking problems into smaller parts and testing regularly during the process.In which my mentor helped me too.

## Next Steps

- Build a hamburger menu for mobile screens.
- Practice form validation with pseudo-classes like :valid and :invalid.
