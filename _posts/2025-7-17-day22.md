## Day 21 – Continued Progress

Today was an intense continuation of the **web design challenge project**. While I made decent progress on structure and layout, I found myself **struggling a lot with minor elements** — things like perfect spacing, icon alignment, button styling, and getting tiny visual details _just right_.

## What I Worked On

- Tried to refine the hero section — positioning the image, aligning CTA buttons, and managing responsiveness.
- Spent a lot of time tweaking padding, margins, and layout responsiveness.
- Realized I was going _too deep_ into perfectionism, which slowed down overall progress.
- Attempted multiple versions of layout spacing before settling on a balanced one.
- Started touching up visual consistency — font sizes, colors, button radius, and icon sizing.

## The Struggle is Real

One big realization today:

> **Perfectionism can become a blocker.**

I was stuck for almost an hour just trying to align two elements pixel-perfectly. While I was learning a lot from the process, it also made me realize that in real-world workflows, balancing **progress and polish** is key. Getting things to "good enough" quickly and refining later is often the better strategy.

## Bonus Learning: WordPress

Another major part of today’s experience was **learning to work with WordPress**:

- Explored how themes and page builders work.
- Understood how HTML/CSS fits into WordPress environments.
- Tried editing pages and inspecting source files.
- Got familiar with limitations vs. custom coding freedom.

It gave me a fresh perspective on **designing within a CMS** and how it differs from hand-coded development.

## Takeaways from Today

- Obsessing over small details too early can burn time.
- It’s okay to iterate — start simple, then refine.
- WordPress is a powerful tool, but it requires a different mindset than raw HTML/CSS.
- Struggles are where the best learning happens — today was full of them.

Tomorrow, I’ll try to move faster and focus more on _completing sections_ rather than perfecting them too early.
