### 📝 Overview

Today was a productive day focused on getting deeper into the world of CSS. I explored various selector types, styling hierarchies, and advanced color techniques.

### 🔍 What I Did

- **Pseudo-class selectors**  
  Learned how to style elements based on their state (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`, `:nth-child()`).

- **Pseudo-element selectors**  
  Explored selectors like `::before`, `::after`, and how they let you insert and style virtual elements.

- **Selector specificity**  
  Understood how CSS decides which rule takes precedence, including the concept of **weight** and **how to manipulate it** effectively.

- **Inheritance**  
  Studied how CSS properties are inherited, when they’re not, and how to:

  - Force inheritance using `inherit`
  - Prevent it using `initial` or `unset`

- **Color concepts**  
  Worked with various color representations:

  - HEX, RGB, HSL
  - Transparency using RGBA and HSLA

- **Gradients**
  - Implemented **linear**, **radial**, and **conic gradients**
  - Played around with creative background styles using `background-image: radial-gradient(...)`

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements are powerful for interactivity and fine control.
- Understanding specificity is essential to avoid confusing style conflicts.
- CSS inheritance isn't automatic — knowing how to control it gives cleaner code.
- Gradients add depth and style when used thoughtfully.
