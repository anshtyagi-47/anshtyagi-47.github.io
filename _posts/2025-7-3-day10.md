# Day 10 – 4/7/2025

## What I Learned Today

Today was all about **CSS Grids**, and it was definitely one of the more challenging days in my journey so far. Here's what I covered:

- `grid-template-rows` and `grid-template-columns`
- `grid-row` and `grid-column` spanning
- The difference between `auto`, `fr`, and `px` units in grid
- How to control spacing using `row-gap` and `column-gap`
- Nesting and placing items using `grid-area`
- Grid behavior in responsive designs using **media queries**

## What I Struggled With

- Getting the spacing right between columns — I kept ending up with too much space or no gap at all.
- My layout was breaking badly on larger screens, especially after `@media` kicked in.
- It was confusing to align `.gbox` elements properly inside a `.grid` container — they kept jumping around.
- Struggled to avoid using `grid-auto-rows` but still achieve equal box heights.
- Getting exact placement like the reference image took a lot of tweaking with `grid-row` and `grid-column`.

## Fixes and Tweaks I Made

- Used `grid-column: 2 / 3` instead of just `2` to get better control.
- Fixed excessive gaps by explicitly setting `column-gap: 2px`.
- Replaced `grid-auto-rows` with manual `grid-template-rows` to get more consistent heights.
- Used media queries at `1024px` to change the layout properly for larger screens.

## Key Takeaways

- Grids are powerful but require very precise definitions.
- Always visualize grid lines while debugging layout issues.
- `fr` is flexible, but sometimes using `px` or `%` gives better control for spacing.
- Media queries need careful coordination with existing grid structure to avoid breaking the layout.

## End of Day Reflection

Despite spending a long time debugging layout issues, I’m proud that I didn’t give up. It was one of those days where frustration could have won — but I stuck it out. Tomorrow, I’ll continue improving my grip on advanced layout techniques and maybe even start working on a responsive mini project to test all of this.
