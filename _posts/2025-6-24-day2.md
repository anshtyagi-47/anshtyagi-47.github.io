## Time Spent

**7 hours 43 minutes** (video) + practice

## Focus Areas

- Git installation and configuration  
- Basic Git commands  
- Handling common setup errors  

## What I Did

- Watched a Git & GitHub crash course  
- Installed and configured Git on my system  
- Practiced basic Git commands like `init`, `add`, and `commit`  
- Faced and resolved file path-related errors during setup  
- Planned to start branching and merging (but didn’t begin yet)

## What I Learned

- Git setup is straightforward but vital for version control  
- Commands like `git init`, `git add`, and `git commit` form the core workflow  
- File path errors are common for beginners but can be resolved with attention  
- Git offers complete control over your code's version history and progress

## Next Steps

- Learn branching and merging  
- Push local changes to GitHub  
- Understand remote-tracking branches

## Summary

A slightly confusing but productive day focused on getting comfortable with Git basics. Installation and command-line practice built my confidence, and resolving setup issues gave me a better understanding of how Git operates. Looking forward to exploring branching and syncing with GitHub in the next session.
