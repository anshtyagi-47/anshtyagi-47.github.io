## Day 23 Highlights – July 18, 2025

Today was focused on layout precision and completing the structure of the webpage. I spent most of the time working on accurate placement of elements within containers, ensuring everything aligns visually and behaves correctly in the layout.

### Main Progress:

- Positioned multiple sub-elements inside container blocks
- Focused on alignment and nesting of divisions within sections
- Ensured images were placed accurately without breaking the layout
- Wrote approximately 500 lines of HTML and CSS code
- Completed two small tasks:
  - A blog post template
  - A QR layout component

### Challenges Faced:

- Struggled with relative vs absolute positioning inside nested containers
- Fine-tuning margins and padding for consistent spacing
- Managing layout flow while placing media elements inside flex/grid structures

### What’s Left:

- Minor modifications in spacing and alignment
- Final pass for responsiveness and visual polish
- Cleanup and optimization of CSS

Overall, the structure of the page is almost complete. Most of today was spent on getting small things right and learning how even minor positioning errors can impact the full layout. A productive day with some solid layout experience gained.
