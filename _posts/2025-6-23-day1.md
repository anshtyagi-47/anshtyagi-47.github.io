Today marks the first day of my web development training, and I dedicated it entirely to strengthening my foundation in HTML. I followed the MDN Web Docs – Core HTML module and took a deep dive into how the web works, especially focusing on structuring content using HTML.

## What I Covered

I explored the following key topics:

- Basic structure of an HTML document  
- Text formatting elements like `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<blockquote>`, and `<cite>`  
- Creating links with `<a>` tags  
- Embedding images using `<img>`  
- Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`  
- Tables and forms  
- Semantic HTML elements: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, etc.

## My Approach

I didn’t just read but made my own notes to summarize each concept in simple terms. Writing things down really helped me retain the syntax and understand where each element fits into the bigger picture of a webpage.

## Hands-On Practice

The MDN documentation included interactive challenges after each topic. I completed all of them, and this practical approach made the learning engaging.

Some examples:

- Fixed invalid HTML code  
- Structured an article with proper semantic tags  
- Created a basic navigation section  

## My First Mini Project – Resume in HTML

To wrap up the day, I decided to build something useful with my new skills:  
**My resume in pure HTML** (no CSS for now)

I used:

- `<h1>`, `<h2>` for headings  
- `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<li>` for content  
- `<strong>` for highlights  
- `<hr>` for visual separation  
- Proper nesting and indentation for clean code  

It was satisfying to see my personal data laid out like a real webpage! This mini-project gave me confidence and a sense of achievement for Day 1.

## Reflection

HTML is often seen as the simplest part of web dev—but writing semantic, clean, well-structured HTML is a skill on its own. Revisiting these basics helped me appreciate how much structure matters in web design and accessibility.

> On my first day of web development training, I focused entirely on HTML using the MDN Core HTML module. I revised key concepts like the structure of an HTML document, text formatting, links, images, lists, tables, forms, and semantic elements. I actively took notes, completed interactive challenges, and applied what I learned by building a resume using pure HTML. This hands-on approach helped reinforce my understanding and gave me confidence. The day ended with a strong appreciation for how foundational and important clean, semantic HTML is. Next, I plan to dive into CSS to style the resume and enhance its appearance.
