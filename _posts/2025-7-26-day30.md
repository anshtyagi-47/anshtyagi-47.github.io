## Day 30 Highlights

Today was a **tough but productive day**. I stepped away from the Products page for a bit to work on other crucial parts of the website — **Contact**, **About Us**, and the **Brochure page**.

### Focus of the Day — Multi-Page Completion & Responsiveness

The main objective was to finish these supporting pages while keeping the design consistent and making them responsive.

Here’s what I accomplished:

- **Contact Page**  
  Completed a functional contact page with a clean form, integrated Google Map, and properly styled contact details.

- **About Us Page**  
  Designed and finalized the About Us section to match the site’s theme and provide a clear brand story.

- **Brochure Page Layout**  
  Added a dedicated brochure download page with well-aligned buttons and modern layout.

- **Responsive Design Attempts**  
  Spent a **significant amount of time struggling with media queries** to adjust layouts on different screen sizes. While functional, it still needs refinement.

### What’s Next?

- Revisit media queries to fix minor layout issues
- Add finishing touches (animations, hover states) to new pages
- Optimize brochure page download functionality
- Return focus to completing interactive features for the Products page

### Reflections

Today tested my patience — media queries were particularly challenging. However, completing three major pages feels like a big step forward. Despite struggles, the website is becoming more **comprehensive and structured**, bringing me closer to a full launch.
