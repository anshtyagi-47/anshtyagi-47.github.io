## üß† Reflection

Today was all about strengthening my foundation in CSS and getting hands-on with practical integration. I learned how to style HTML using embedded `<style>` tags and external stylesheets, and I explored how to normalize CSS for consistent appearance. I also pushed my private repositories to GitHub, ensuring version control is in place.

## ‚ú® Key Takeaways

- CSS can be added using both internal (`<style>`) and external (`.css`) files.
- Selectors like tag, class, and ID help target specific HTML elements.
- Normalizing CSS ensures a consistent base across browsers.
- Linking stylesheets properly is essential for styles to load.
- GitHub is great for managing code versions ‚Äî private repos now active!

## üõ† Tools Used

- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
- Chrome browser
- Markdown for writing blogs

## ‚öôÔ∏è Challenges

- Remembering the specificity of different selectors.
- Debugging stylesheet paths while linking externally.

## üí° HTML/CSS Recap

```html
<!-- Linking external stylesheet -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css" />

<!-- Internal CSS using <style> tag -->
<style>
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    background-color: #f5f5f5;
  }
</style>
```
