## Day 27 Highlights

Today was a **big win** — I officially **completed the homepage** of my business website! From initial sketches and structural planning to polished styling and responsiveness, the front face of my site is now live and functioning exactly how I envisioned.

### What I Built Today

After completing 50% of the homepage earlier, I focused on wrapping up the remaining sections with clarity and visual consistency. Here’s what I accomplished:

- **Services Section**  
  Clearly outlined the offerings with icons, brief descriptions, and a consistent card layout.

- **Testimonials Block**  
  Added a testimonials area with quotes and client highlights — giving the page a trustworthy and personal feel.

- **Contact CTA**  
  Placed a clear call-to-action at the bottom with a styled button and anchor to the contact section.

- **Responsive Tweaks**  
  Finalized media queries and ensured the layout holds well across different screen sizes — from mobile to desktop.

- **Styling Polish**  
  Improved padding, alignment, hover states, and transitions for a refined, smooth experience.

### Key Skills Applied

- **Flexbox & Grid** for section layouts
- **Typography and spacing hierarchy** for readability
- **Color consistency** using a defined palette
- **Responsive design** through mobile-first approach
- **Visual finishing touches** with CSS transitions and hover feedback

### Reflections

There’s something special about completing a full webpage from scratch — especially one tied to a personal or professional vision. Every section I built helped me practice real-world layout patterns, responsive principles, and UI design habits.

More than just code, this homepage represents **confidence** — in structuring pages, writing clean CSS, and thinking about design in a practical context.

Now, I’m excited to move forward: add more pages, build interactivity with JavaScript, and turn this into a complete website experience.
