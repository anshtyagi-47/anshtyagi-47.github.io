# ðŸ“… 4/7/2025 - Day 11: Typography + Recipe Layout + System Troubles

## 1. Introduction

I understood what typography is and how it influences readability, visual structure, and overall user experience in web design.

## 2. Styling Fonts

Explored various font properties like `font-family`, `font-style`, and `font-weight` to control text appearance.

## 3. Embedding Web Fonts

Learned how to import Google Fonts using both `<link>` and `@import`, and applied them with proper fallback stacks.

## 4. Flash of Unstyled Text

Understood how FOUT occurs during font loading and how to minimize it using font-display properties.

## 5. Font Services

Got familiar with Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, and other delivery services â€” learned how they affect performance.

## 6. System Font Stack

Learned the importance of using system fonts for performance and consistency, and how to construct a fallback stack.

## 7. Sizing Fonts

Practiced using `px`, `em`, and `rem` for scalable, consistent font sizing across the layout.

## 8. Vertical Spacing

Explored how `line-height`, `margin`, and `padding` contribute to clean vertical rhythm in typography.

## 9. Horizontal Spacing

Studied `letter-spacing` and `word-spacing` to improve text clarity and control visual density.

## 10. Formatting Text

Applied text alignment, transformation, and decoration techniques. Reinforced the importance of semantic tags.

## 11. Recipe Instructions Exercise

Created a styled recipe layout using semantic HTML (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<ul>`) and CSS for spacing, font hierarchy, and layout. I also practiced removing image content and replacing it with styled placeholder containers using Flexbox for centering and spacing.

## System Issue Faced

After switching to Windows for a quick meeting, my Linux OS crashed and became unresponsive. I booted into recovery mode, ran package checks, and attempted to reset GNOME, but the desktop environment is still not working.

Due to this, I couldnâ€™t push:

- The recipe exercise code
- The updated blog post

Iâ€™m currently writing this EOD on my mobile to avoid breaking the daily streak. Tomorrow, Iâ€™ll try further recovery or use a live USB to back up and restore the work.
