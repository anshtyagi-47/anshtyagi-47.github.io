## Day 20 Highlights

Today marks a huge milestone—I completed building my very first full website using everything I’ve learned in the _Code with Mosh_ HTML & CSS course. From structuring the page to styling it responsively and optimizing for performance, I put together a complete, functioning site entirely from scratch.

It was incredibly satisfying to see all the pieces I’ve learned over the past weeks come together into something real and usable.

## What I Accomplished

- Finalized a multi-section homepage with a professional layout and design.
- Integrated hero, navigation, features, testimonials, pricing, and footer sections.
- Ensured full responsiveness across screen sizes using media queries and fluid layouts.
- Improved typography and spacing for a modern and readable UI.
- Refactored and cleaned my CSS for better maintainability and structure.
- Tested in multiple browsers to ensure consistency.

## Skills Applied

- Semantic HTML5 for clear content structure.
- Advanced CSS techniques including flexbox, utility classes, and custom properties.
- Responsive design principles with breakpoints and scalable units.
- Layout composition using real-world design techniques.
- Image optimization and alt attribute usage for accessibility.
- Code organization and file structuring for clean workflow.

## Reflection

Completing this site was a huge confidence boost. I’ve gone from barely understanding how `<div>`s work to building a polished, responsive site with clean design and structure. I now truly appreciate how much thought goes into every padding, margin, and font choice—and how powerful CSS really is in shaping the user experience.

More than that, I’ve learned how to debug layout issues, think in sections, and build something that feels like a "real" website. It’s exciting to know that this is just the beginning.

**Next Up:** I’ll be diving into deploying the site and beginning the JavaScript section of the course. Time to make things interactive!
