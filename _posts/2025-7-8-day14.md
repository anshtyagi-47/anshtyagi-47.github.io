## Day 13 Highlights

Today I focused on CSS background properties, especially how to create dynamic and interactive visual experiences. I worked through an exercise that required manipulating various background features and enhancing user interaction.

## What I learned

- Usage of background-size, background-position, and background-repeat.
- Creating visual effects using linear-gradient and radial-gradient.
- Making backgrounds dynamic using hover effects and transitions.
- Layering background images with gradient overlays for depth.

## Exercise Completed

- Animated background using CSS keyframes for movement.
- Combined multiple backgrounds, including images and gradients, with blend modes.

## Concepts Practiced

- background-image, background-blend-mode, background-attachment
- Responsive background behavior with media queries
- Transition effects and keyframe animations for background changes

## Reflection

Working with dynamic backgrounds provided insight into how subtle changes in visuals can improve user experience. It also allowed me to experiment with CSS-only solutions for effects that typically require JavaScript.

## Next Steps

- Implement parallax effects using background-attachment: fixed
- Create animated sections using only keyframes and background-position
- Try combining backgrounds with clip-path and shape effects
