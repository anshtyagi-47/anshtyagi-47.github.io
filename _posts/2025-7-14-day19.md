## Day 16 Highlights

Today I continued working on the homepage layout, focusing on refining key visual sections like the navigation bar, hero block, and features section. I applied image optimization techniques, flex-based layout alignment, and created structured content blocks that made the page feel more polished and functional.

## What I learned

- Implemented the navigation bar with proper link spacing, alignment, and responsiveness.
- Built a visually engaging hero section with a headline, CTA, and optimized image.
- Practiced image compression and used correct file formats to improve load performance.
- Created a clean and responsive features block using flex layout.
- Understood how each section needs consistent spacing, padding, and content structure.
- Realized how different it feels applying layout rules in real sections versus isolated exercises.

## Exercise Completed

- Structured the navigation bar using flexbox for alignment and distribution.
- Designed and optimized the hero image for fast loading and clarity.
- Added semantic HTML to structure content meaningfully across blocks.
- Built a features block with icons and text to highlight product value.
- Adjusted spacing and alignment to ensure clean transitions between sections.

## Concepts Practiced

- Flexbox for navigation and feature layouts.
- Image optimization through resizing and format selection (SVG, WebP).
- Section padding, gap control, and responsive resizing.
- Structuring reusable layout blocks in a real webpage.
- Ensuring accessibility through proper tag usage and alt attributes.

## Reflection

Today was all about connecting layout knowledge with performance and structure. While building the navigation, hero, and features blocks, I understood how foundational layout techniques like flex and padding contribute to the overall user experience. Optimizing the hero image made a noticeable difference in load speed, and I found myself constantly refining small layout
