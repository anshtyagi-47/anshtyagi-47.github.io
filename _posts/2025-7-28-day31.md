## Day 31 Highlights

Today marked a **wrap-up phase** where I finalized the desktop design of the website and reflected on my overall learning experience during this training journey.

### Focus of the Day — Final Tweaks & Learning Reflections

The primary tasks were to polish the remaining desktop elements and document the key lessons learned from the past month of building the site.

Here’s what I accomplished:

- **Final Desktop Design Changes**  
  Reviewed all pages and made final refinements to spacing, typography, and alignment for a polished, professional look.

- **Mobile-First Design Realization**  
  Learned the importance of **designing for mobile first** instead of adjusting a desktop layout later. This insight will shape how I approach future projects.

- **Documented Training Learnings**  
  Created an **appointment/summary note** compiling the most important lessons, techniques, and best practices learned throughout the web development training.

### What’s Next?

- Plan a mobile-first redesign approach for upcoming projects
- Organize and archive all training notes and completed files
- Explore adding performance optimizations and accessibility checks
- Prepare a full walkthrough or portfolio presentation of the project

### Reflections

Finalizing the desktop version felt satisfying but also eye-opening — retrofitting for mobile is challenging. This experience reinforced that **starting with a mobile-first mindset** leads to cleaner, more scalable responsive designs.

Documenting my learnings also highlighted just how far I’ve come in HTML, CSS, layout design, and problem-solving.
