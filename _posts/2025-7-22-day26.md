## Day 26 Highlights

Today was all about **balance** — juggling between **Training & Placement Cell meetings**, multiple career-related calls, and still managing to make solid progress on my business website. While it wasn’t a fully code-intensive day, it was definitely a **productive and purposeful** one.

### Training & Placement Activities

The first half of my day was focused on career-building tasks:

- Attended a couple of **T&P Cell meetings** related to upcoming placement drives and profile preparation.
- Had important **calls and discussions** around resume updates, interview readiness, and soft skills.
- Took notes on things to improve — especially around technical communication and presenting my portfolio effectively.

These sessions reminded me how crucial it is to **align technical skills with real-world presentation and clarity**. Building projects is important, but being able to _explain_ them well is equally vital.

### Business Website – Homepage (50% Done!)

Even with the busy schedule, I carved out time to continue working on my homepage — and managed to complete **half of the layout**!

Here’s what I tackled:

- Finalized the **hero section**, complete with headline, subtext, CTA button, and imagery.
- Structured the **navigation bar** and started implementing sticky behavior.
- Built the **"About the Business"** section with clean layout and responsive behavior.
- Tweaked spacing, alignment, and typography for a consistent and modern look.

It feels amazing to see the homepage taking shape, slowly turning into a polished piece of work.

### Reflections

Days like this are important reminders that progress isn’t always just about writing code. Sometimes it’s about stepping back, preparing for what’s ahead, and integrating your learning into a broader professional journey.

I’m proud that even with meetings and distractions, I pushed the project forward. Consistency — even in small chunks — adds up.
