### 📝 Overview

Today wasn’t a high-output day as I wasn’t feeling well. Despite that, I decided to keep the momentum going with some light revision and beginner-level CSS exploration.

### 🔁 What I Did

- **Revised previously learned concepts**  
  I went over the HTML structure, VS Code shortcuts, and project organization tips from earlier days to reinforce my foundation.

- **Touched on CSS basics**  
  Learned the fundamentals of CSS including:
  - How to write and link CSS files
  - Simple selectors and rules
  - Syntax and structure

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Revision helps retain knowledge even on slow days.
- CSS uses a clear rule-based syntax, and selectors are crucial for targeting elements effectively.
- Revised notes i made.

### 🧘 Reflection

It wasn’t my most productive day, but I’m glad I stayed consistent. Showing up — even for a short session — is part of building long-term habits.

### 🚀 What’s Next

- Dive deeper into the CSS box model and layout techniques.
